Verhalenwebsite DFDS - DFDStories
==============

Synopsis
--------------

This project is a website for a travel company called DFDS. On this page you can search for and read pre-defined stories, as well as adding your own travel pictures to the stories, to create a dynamic reading experience for everyone who is using the website.
The website allows you to log in, so you can save the stories you want to read later to your profile. Also when you are logged in, you get the potential to save the stories offline to your mobile device, so you can allways read them, even when the network is offline.
The current version is already packaged with a **DIST** folder. To check this project out offline simply copy the **DIST** folder, as well as the **HTML** folder and the **index.html**. Then you can simply see the project by double clicking on the index.html page locally.
If you want to start the server by yourself and check things out or change something around, feel free to do so, by typing *gulp watch* in the correct folder (where the **package.json** is located). This will spin up a server for you to work in.

Motivation
--------------
I created this project, because of a school task. The task was to create a article-like reading website for a company, which I could choose myself. I choose DFDS, because I believe they have got something really good going with their design. It is stylish, while staying useful.
I will not be maintaining this version of the project, but rather will make a new REPO where I will make this project work fully in REACT.js, as well as some NODE.js. Link to this will be here when available.
